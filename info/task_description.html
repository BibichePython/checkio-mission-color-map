    In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any
    separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than
    four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have
    the same color. Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a
    corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.
    For model we will use a grid with square cells.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a region map as a grid (matrix). There are placed <strong>N</strong> countries.
    Each country has a number from 0 to N-1. Two cells are adjacent if they have a common edge.
    Each country has one or more cells that are connected. Thus you can move between any cells of
    the country X just using for this adjacent cells.
    <br>
    Each cell is marked by a number of a country.
</p>
<p>
    You should "color" a map with <strong>4</strong> colors. All cells of the one country
    should have one color. Adjacent cells of various country should not have the same color.
</p>
<p>
    The result should be represented as a sequence of numbers 1,2,3 or 4.
    Each element show a color of the country with that index. For example,
    the 0th element shows a color of the country 0. So the result should have N-1 elements.
